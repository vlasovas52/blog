## Start of the week

Again the week started off with great weather, every morning I went out for a run, exercising.

## University

Studying German is well underway, I started learning Angular framework and I'm still learning TypeScript.

## Making a game

Spent half of the week testing a new game, found a few bugs that I haven't managed to fix yet. I drew a few more new objects.

## Poetry

Wrote a couple more poems.

## Website

No orders for websites yet, but I started writing one myself to test Angular and TypeScript. It turned out pretty good.

## Conclusion

I had a pretty boring week, but I met up with some friends over the weekend and had more fun.
