## New school week

The week started off pretty hard, there were a lot of assignments that needed to be done, but luckily I got everything done.

## Game Development

In my free time I worked on my game on Unity. I added sound and visual effects for the character, drew new sprites for other objects in the game.

## Preparing for a test paper

Prepared for a test paper on matnematic analysis, it was quite easy, the topic was easy.

## Weekend

I finished my week with a Sunday trip to the movie theater, the movie was pretty boring, but it was fun and interesting to watch even in the company of friends.
