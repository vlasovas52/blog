## Introduction to Version Control

In modern software development, Version Control System (VCS) is a must-have toolkit. Among distributed VCSs, Git, developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005, holds a special place. Its architecture is based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of commits, which provides efficient change history management.

### Theoretical Foundations of Git

### Data Storage Model

Git implements the concept of file system snapshots. Unlike delta-based systems that store differences between versions, Git stores the full state of files at each commit, using the SHA-1 hashing mechanism to identify objects.

### Branching Mechanism

Branching in Git is the creation of a movable pointer to a specific commit. This implementation is highly efficient because it does not require duplicate files. Merging is accomplished through a three-way algorithm that takes into account the common ancestor.

### Practical Application Considerations

### Distributed Architecture

Each Git repository contains a complete history of changes, which provides:
- Autonomous operation
- Increased fault tolerance
- Flexible collaboration between developers

### Change Management

The work process includes:
- Change indexing (staging area)
- Committing
- Verifying history (log analysis)
- Synchronization with remote repositories (push/pull)

## Benchmarking

Git shows advantages over centralized systems (SVN, CVS):
- Locality of operations
- Impossibility of history loss
- Support for non-linear development
- Efficient use of disk space

## Conclusion

Learning Git is of significant value to future software development professionals. Its theoretical foundations illustrate advanced change management approaches, and its practical implementation sets a new standard for VCS. Further research could focus on analyzing conflict resolution algorithms and optimizing large repositories.
