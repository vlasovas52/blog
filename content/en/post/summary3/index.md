## Start of the week

The week started off with a huge amount of rain and cold, my mood was at zero. By the middle of the week it started to get warmer and sunnier.

## Sports

I finally found time to do some sports, went to the tourniquets, played table tennis.

## Test and other studies

Wrote a test on mathematical analysis for the maximum score, not in vain. I defended several programming labs and passed all my debts.

## Creating a game

I continued writing the game, but stopped on drawing sprites for characters, thought over the further plot.

## Poetry

Tried to write my first poem, it turned out pretty good.

## Conclusion

I had a good week, it's a shame I didn't get out this weekend.
