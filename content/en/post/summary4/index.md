## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text using simple characters. Its main advantage is readability both in its original form and after conversion.

### Main features

### Headings

Markdown supports six levels of headings, allowing you to create a clear structure for your document.

### Text Formatting

Use simple characters to italicize or bold text, create strikethrough text and monospaced text.

### Lists

The language offers a convenient syntax for creating both numbered and bulleted lists, including multi-level nesting.

### Links and Images

Insert hyperlinks and images in an intuitive way without compromising the readability of the source text.

### Code and Citations

For technical documentation, the ability to insert code blocks and citations is particularly useful.

### Benefits of Markdown

The main strength of Markdown is its versatility. Documents display equally well in any text editor and on all modern platforms.

## Applications in modern development

Today Markdown has become the standard for project documentation, technical blogging, and content creation for static site generators.

## Future of the language

Despite the emergence of alternatives, Markdown continues to evolve, retaining its original simplicity and elegance.
