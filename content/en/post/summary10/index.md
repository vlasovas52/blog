TypeScript is no longer just a trendy tool - it's a necessity for professional web development. Here are the top reasons to switch to TypeScript:

## Reliability and predictability
TypeScript's static typing catches errors before the code runs. No more surprises like “undefined is not a function” in production.

## Improved development experience
Smart hints and autocompletion in the IDE work much better thanks to the type system. You spend less time reading documentation.

## Better scalability
TypeScript is ideal for large projects and teamwork. The type system serves as a living documentation and simplifies code maintenance.

## Smooth migration
You don't have to rewrite your entire project at once. You can gradually add types to existing JavaScript code.

## State-of-the-art features
TypeScript includes all the latest JavaScript features plus additional features like interfaces, generics, and decorators.

## Community Support
TypeScript is supported by Microsoft and is heavily used in Angular, Vue 3, React, and other popular frameworks.

Switching to TypeScript is an investment in the quality of your code and your professional development. You may start gradually, but the result is worth it.
