## Start of the week

The week began with intense preparation for a discrete math quiz. It was pretty straightforward.

## First game release

The first version of the game has been finished, I've uploaded it to the Yandex games site. It turned out pretty good, but there is room for improvement.

## Language learning

Further I continue to learn German, it is much harder than English. I am trying to develop my vocabulary.

## Finally got out of the house

On the weekend I had a chance to meet some friends I haven't seen for a long time. We discussed a lot of things, it was quite fun.
